This is a try to build a piece of hard- and software, to make it as easy as possible to get OpenWrt on your device.

In this early state, a shield made for RasperryPi is used. But schematics of course could be used to port it to any hardware you like and on which linux could run on.

The software-part is realized by a bash script, trying to use as less dependencies as possible.

The project right now is in the early beta phase.
